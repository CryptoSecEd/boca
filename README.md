BoCA (Blockchain-of-Custody Applications) can be used to post data to either the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) or Ethereum (ETH) blockchains.

You can post either individual files or folders, and data can be encrypted. If you and another address both exchange any amount of cryptocurrency, you can use each others public keys to encrypt any content.

Data can be shared via the IPFS network.
